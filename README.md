# ds-quickstart
Data science quickstart

Getting going with the right tools to help you get the job done.

## Intro

Overcome the barriers to just getting started.

Broken down into a series of projects, each for a different tool.

Each project will contain the following.

* Links to source / documentations
* Environment setup instructions
* "hello world"
* Just the basics - examples of most common actions
* Cheat sheet - a one-page reference for important commands

Assumed starting point: osx (High Sierra)
Will use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager for installations:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
